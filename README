This program contains the files DataLoop.cpp, DataLoop.h, DataLoopTest.cpp, TDataLoop.h, 
TDataLoop.inc, TDataLoopTest.cpp, and the Makefile. The Makefile creates executables for
DataLoopTest and TDataLoopTest.

DataLoop.h contains the prototypes of the functions and the definition of the class DataLoop. 
DataLoop.cpp contains the implementations of the constructors and functions in the .h file. The 
TDataLoop files follow a similar strucutre with the .inc file containing the implementations instead
of a .cpp file.

Many of the functions are overloaded assignment operator functions which allow DataLoop objects to be
modified by adding, splicing, concatenating, and preforming other actions. In addition, the Rule of 3
is exemplified in this program as there exists a copy constructor, non-trivial destructor, and a 
overloaded assignment operator.

Something clever I did in my program was add two public helper functions: add and clear. The add helper method
added a node of an inputted value to the end of the DataLoop, and the clear function was used primarily to deallocated memory.
These helper functions served useful in removing unecessary code, and helped throughout the program.

I was able to complete all parts of the program.
